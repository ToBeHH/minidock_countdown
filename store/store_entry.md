# Description
A countdown app for meetings, exams or other time relevant situations. It displays the remaining time, a visual representation (bar or arc) of the remaining time and a color coding (green, yellow when below 30% and red when below 15%). The color coding can be displayed on the ambient light as well. The remaining time can also be shown on the big clock. Everything is configurable via the settings.
